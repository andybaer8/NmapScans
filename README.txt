This is a Java tool that automates the process of scanning for open ports on a network. To use it, compile to a jar then run it. 
When prompted, input the range of IP's you wish to scan (ex. 123.4.56.78-90). The resuls are written to 'scansOutput.csv', located in the directory that you ran this from.

NOTE: This is for Windows only, and requires Nmap (nmap.org) to be installed and on your Path.
